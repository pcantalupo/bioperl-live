BIOPERL INSTALLATION

The following are instructions for installing BioPerl on
Unix, Linux, and Mac OS X. Windows installation instructions can be 
found in INSTALL.WIN.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

    * Perl 5.6.1 or later; version 5.8 and greater are highly
      recommended. Modules are generally tested against perl 5.8 and
      above.
    * make. For Mac OS X, this requires installing the Xcode Developer 
      Tools.


PRELIMINARY PREPARATION

These are optional, but regardless of your subsequent choice of
installation method, it will help to carry out the following steps.
They will increase the likelyhood of installation success
(especially of optional dependencies).

     * Upgrade CPAN:

 >perl -MCPAN -e shell
 cpan>install Bundle::CPAN

     * Install/upgrade Module::Build, and make it your preferred
       installer:

 >cpan
 cpan>install Module::Build
 cpan>o conf prefer_installer MB
 cpan>o conf commit

     * Install the expat library by whatever method is
       appropriate for your system (e.g. yum, homebrew).


INSTALLING BIOPERL THE EASY WAY USING CPAN

You can use the CPAN shell to install BioPerl. For example:

 >perl -MCPAN -e shell

Or you might have the cpan alias installed:

 >cpan

Then find the name of the latest BioPerl package:

 cpan>d /bioperl/

 ....

Distribution    CJFIELDS/BioPerl-1.6.901.tar.gz
Distribution    CJFIELDS/BioPerl-1.6.922.tar.gz
Distribution    CJFIELDS/BioPerl-1.6.923.tar.gz

And install:

 cpan>install CJFIELDS/BioPerl-1.6.923.tar.gz

If you've installed everything perfectly and all the network
connections are working then you will pass all the tests run in the
'./Build test' phase. Sometimes you may see a failed test. Remember that 
there are over 900 modules in BioPerl and the test suite is running more 
than 12000 individual tests, a failed test may not affect your usage 
of BioPerl.

If there's a failed test and you think that the failed test will not 
affect how you intend to use BioPerl then do:

 cpan>force install C/CJ/CJFIELDS/BioPerl-1.6.923.tar.gz

If you're concerned about a failed test and need assistance or advice
then contact bioperl-l@bioperl.org, and provide us the detailed
results of the failed install.


INSTALLING BIOPERL FROM GITHUB

The very latest version of Bioperl is at github.com. If you want this 
version then download it from https://github.com/bioperl/bioperl-live
as a *zip file, or retrieve it using the command line:

 >git clone https://github.com/bioperl/bioperl-live.git
 >cd bioperl-live

If you've downloaded the *zip file then unzip that and cd to the
BioPerl directory.

Issue the build commands:

 >perl Build.PL

You will be asked a few questions about installing BioPerl scripts
and running various test suites, hit <return> to accept the defaults.

Test and install:

 >./Build test
 >./Build install

You may need root permissions in order to run './Build install', so you 
will want to talk to your systems manager if you don't have the necessary
privileges.

It is also straightforward to install the package in your own home
directory, see INSTALLING BIOPERL USING local::lib, below.


INSTALLING BIOPERL USING local::lib

If you lack permission to install Perl modules into the standard
system directories you can install them in your home directory
using local::lib. The instructions for first installing
local::lib are found here:

http://search.cpan.org/search?query=local%3A%3Alib

Once local::lib is installed you can install BioPerl using a 
command like this:

 >perl -MCPAN -Mlocal::lib -e 'CPAN::install(C/CJ/CJFIELDS/BioPerl-1.6.923.tar.gz)'


EXTERNAL PROGRAMS

BioPerl can interface with some external programs for executing
analyses. These include clustalw and t_coffee for Multiple Sequence
Alignment (Bio::Tools::Run::Alignment::Clustalw and
Bio::Tools::Run::Alignment::TCoffee) and blastall, blastpgp, and
bl2seq for BLAST analyses (Bio::Tools::Run::StandAloneBlast), and to
all the programs in the EMBOSS suite (Bio::Factory::EMBOSS).  Most
of the modules which 'wrap' these programs are located in the separate
bioperl-run distribution; however, two commonly-used modules are still
distributed with the BioPerl core (Bio::Tools::Run::StandAloneBlast,
Bio::Tools::Run::RemoteBlast).

    * Environment Variables

Some modules which run external programs need certain environment
variables set. If you do not have a local copy of the specific
executable you do not need to set these variables. Additionally the
modules will attempt to locate the specific applications in your
runtime PATH variable. You may also need to set an environment
variable to tell BioPerl about your network configuration if your site
uses a firewall.

Setting environment variables on unix means adding lines like the
following to your shell *rc file.

   For bash or sh:

 export BLASTDIR=/data1/blast

   For csh or tcsh:

 setenv BLASTDIR /data1/blast

Some environment variables include:

+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Env. Variable |                      Description                       |
|---------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
|               |Specifies where the NCBI blastall, blastpgp, bl2seq,    |
|BLASTDIR       |etc.. are located. A 'data' directory could also be     |
|               |present in this directory as well, you could put your   |
|               |blastable databases here.                               |
|---------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
|               |If one does not want to locate the data dir within the  |
|BLASTDATADIR or|same dir as where the BLASTDIR variable points, a       |
|BLASTDB        |BLASTDATADIR or BLASTDB variable can be set to point to |
|               |a dir where BLAST database indexes are located.         |
|---------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
|BLASTMAT       |The directory containing the substitution matrices such |
|               |as BLOSUM62.                                            |
|---------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
|CLUSTALDIR     |The directory where the clustalw executable is located. |
|---------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
|TCOFFEEDIR     |The directory where the t_coffee executable is located. |
|---------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
|               |If you access the internet via a proxy server then you  |
|               |can tell the BioPerl modules which require network      |
|               |access about this by using the http_proxy environment   |
|http_proxy     |variable. The value set includes the proxy address and  |
|               |the port, with optional username/password for           |
|               |authentication purposes                                 |
|               |(e.g. http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@proxy.example.com:8080). |

INSTALLING BIOPERL SCRIPTS

BioPerl comes with a set of production-quality scripts that are
kept in the scripts/ directory. You can install these scripts if you'd
like, simply answer the questions during 'perl Build.PL'.
The installation directory can be specified by:

 perl Build.PL
 ./Build install --install_path script=/foo/scripts

By default they install to /usr/bin or similar, depending on platform.


THE TEST SYSTEM

The BioPerl test system is located in the t/ directory and is
automatically run whenever you execute the './Build test' command.

For the 1.6 release and beyond, tests have been organized into groups
based upon the specific task or class the module being tested belongs
to. If you want to investigate the behavior of a specific test such as
the Seq test you would type:

 >./Build test --test_files t/Seq/Seq.t --verbose

The --test_files argument can be used multiple times to try a set of test 
scripts in one go. The --verbose arguement outputs the detailed test results, 
instead of just the summary you see during './Build test'.

The '--test-files' argument can also work as a glob. For instance, to
run tests on all SearchIO modules, use the following:

 >./Build test --test_files t/SearchIO* --verbose

If you are trying to learn how to use a module, often the test suite
is a good place to look. All good extreme programmers try and write a
test BEFORE they write the module to insure that their module behaves
the way they expect. You'll notice some 'ok' and 'skip' commands in a
test, this is part of the Perl test suite that signifies a passed test
with an 'ok N', where N is the test number. Alternatively you can tell
Perl to skip tests. This is useful when, for example, your test
detects that the network is not present and thus should skip, not
fail, any tests that require a network connection.

The core developers have indicated that future releases of BioPerl
will require that new modules come with a test suite with some minimal
tests.  Modules that lack adequate tests or could otherwise be
considered 'unstable' will be moved into a separate developer
distribution until adequate tests are added and the API stablizes.
